* About
Sway is a *window manager* utilizing the new wayland protocol. In wayland window
managers are required to perform more functions than what was required of them
under Xorg. As a result, the name *compositor* may sometimes be used to
differentiate them from Xorg window managers, stressing their particular role
under wayland.

A window manager or (WM) for short is a program that controls the placement and
appearance of windowns within a windowing system in a graphical user
interface(GUI). It may be used as part of desktop environment (suite of
programs) or standalone.
